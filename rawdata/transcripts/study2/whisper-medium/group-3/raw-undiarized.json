        "text": " Okay, being recorded. Okay, recording has started. Once the cat is on the screen, you guys can start, but I'll read the instructions first. Show the checkerboard to the cameras. Hello, and thank you for your participation in this study. Today you will be completing the weights task with the help of Joe, your assistive agent. Joe will intervene as needed. For this task, you will determine the weights of the blocks in front of you. All of the block weights are in intervals of 10, so you don't need to touch the slider on the scale. Please submit your answers on the tablet. And I will tell you that the red block is 10 grams. You can now begin the task, and you will be group three. So are we working together? Yes. Okay. So you said the red one is 10. And we can just type things and move them around? Okay. So I'm just going to put this here then. And then I'll put this here as well. Is that cat going to tell me what to do? Is he just looking at us? It's, I mean, I feel like it's oscillating just because it's not settled yet. But like if I set this. Try to. Yeah, there you go. I'm going to say these are the same weight. I agree. Set that there. So the blue block is also 10? So blue, red, or equal. I'm going to start working. Well, if blue and red are equal, how about we do something with the marks? So let's try this and let's see if they are equal. If these are, if these are total 20, this feels a little bit heavier. Somehow they're intervals of 10, are they? They're intervals of 10. So it wouldn't make sense for that to be like. Will it make a difference if we're leaning on the table? Like, because it feels right or no. Okay. And just making sure. I'm going to swap out the green one for the yellow and purple one and see if we get any different results. Okay. So let's put this on there. That's very different. I'm just actually just going to put that back for now. All right, it's heavy. Put the purple on there. That's also heavier. Okay. I'm going to say green is 20. Yeah, I think if we say green is 20. Because I don't think that's. Process of elimination. Yeah, because it can't, you know, if it can't be. Pardon the interruption. I wonder if we're overlooking the possibility that the green block could be heavier than we think. Is it past the red? Or is it? I can't see it too well. It's slightly on this side, I thought. So these two are heavier? They're heavier than we thought. Well, okay. So I was thinking that. If I may interject. Why is it talking to us? So I think we can assume purple is 30 grams. Can we? Yes, can we now? This cat maybe is a little bit smarter than we are. Maybe. Are we just going in intervals of 10? Is that how he's figuring it? Well, I mean, it has to be intervals of 10. But let's, okay, let me do something. I mean, I can see it right there. Well, I want to show. If it said that the purple is 30. Then what if we put it. Let me set the blue block here. Assuming that the camera is looking at us from over here. I think the green is less than 20. I mean, yeah. It seems like it. It does seem like a little bit less than 20. Part of the interruption. All right, bro. Are we sure about the purple block? I feel like we might be rushing into this. I'm going to ignore what you just said for a moment. This is weird. I'm going to assume. I really think they're the same, like as close as you can get. In terms of 10. I think green is 20. I think it's 30 grams, right? Meaning if we're if we're checking to see if purple is 30 grams, like what the cat said, then I'm going to put this red one with the green. Purple and these should balance. Although it's taking. It's it's still like balancing kind of. It's like it's with if we let's say that this is within our margin of error. You know, we didn't was OK. What's up? I'm still a little unsure about the purple block. Should we double check? And how might we do that? OK, about this. I'll move the the blue block on top of the green one instead of the red one and see if that changes anything because we're assuming the blue and the red one are also the same way to 10 grams. We need to write that down. Do we need to? No, you know, the tabloid is. Oh, there's a serve in there. OK. OK. Enter answers. Now. It just asks for it. Consider this. Considering. Let's double check the purple block against the yellow one to see if we can confirm our earlier assumption. That the purple block is 30 grams? I mean, I'm pretty sure that just by feeling it, the yellow one feels heavier, and it is. So whatever. And OK, let me do this. Let's say this is 20, and that is 30, right? So if I put 20 and 30 together, and if this kind of balances, then we can assume that maybe the yellow block is 50. Now, am I considering? OK, considering. I wonder if we should double check the yellow block's weight against the green block again to be certain. OK. What do we say the green block was again? We're kind of getting lost. 20. 20. OK. That makes sense. That was pretty close, though. Yeah, I'd say that was a close call. I'd say, yeah. I mean. But we still know how much the purple is. Or do we assume that the purple was? I'm going to assume that the purple is 30. It's a purple? Because the yellow one is purple heavier than the green. Purple is heavier than the green. So yeah. So basically what I'm thinking is red and blue are both 10. Green is 20. Purple is 30. And yellow is 50. 50. What do you think about that, Mr. Cat? I was thinking. OK. But how do we know that the purple is heavier than the green? Let's put them both on this. I mean, just so you're convinced. Because I know you don't have to. It feels heavier. Right? It feels heavier. We put it on the scale. The green one is above. And the purple one is below. So it's pretty clear. And these are measurements of 10. Yeah. And way more than 5 grams. Yeah, because the only adjustments that we could make, but we're not supposed to make, on this fancy scale, is yeah. So yeah. We know. If I may interject. OK. I'm feeling like we should double check the purple block. It seems off to me. Well, you should check your facts. You know? Yeah, that's a little confusing. I don't know how to explain that. What does he think the purple block is? I don't know. Like 32.7 or something. He just wants to double check. Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good. OK. I wonder if we should double check the purple block's weight to be sure it's 50 grams. We're not saying the purple block is 50 grams. We're saying the purple block is 30 grams. And that the yellow block is 50 grams. Yeah, it looks pretty close. It looks like it's a little more than 30. Just very slightly. But if we're assuming that all of these blocks are in intervals of 10 grams, then we can say that it's 30 grams. Hey, team. All right. I think we should double check the purple block again. It could be heavier than we think. It's heavier than 30. I'd say, probably a little bit. Let's swap this over. But again, we're in intervals of 10. 32 and 1.5, like Benito said earlier. Pardon the interruption. I agree. It seems likely that purple is 30 grams. But we should double check that against the other blocks. How do you think we came to that conclusion? Double check with using the red? I mean, I guess. Would that be double checking? Because we assume that the blue and the red. Let's double check that the purple block is 30. That looks like a pretty good double check. It's a pretty good double check, yeah. And it looks pretty conclusive. Yeah, that positioning looks better than we've ever met it. And we know it's heavier than the green and lighter than the yellow. What do you have to say, Mr. Cat? He's thinking. It better be. Were you silent or were you silenced? Hey, team. Yep. I think we should also consider the possibility that the purple block might be heavier than we think. I think you've said that before. The scale's even, man. Can we vote to kick this cat off the team? I think we can get further without them. When does the experiment end? Whenever you're satisfied with the answers. Just put them on the tablet. Once you've submitted those answers, you're done. OK, so 50 yellow. Green is 20. Blue is 10. And purple is 30. 10, 10, 10, 30. Are we sure that the scale is balanced? Oh, that's actually a good. We need to revisit our assumptions about the weight. That's the first actually good thing that you've said in a very long time, because I don't actually think that the scale is perfectly balanced. I actually put a couple of things on the other side and it seemed like it didn't balance quite the same way. But I also don't think it's so unbalanced that we can't use it to do intervals of 10. But that was the first good thing that you've said this entire time, as far as I'm concerned. We are not making it. These screws look pretty even, though. I don't know how else to make it, how else to balance that out. Unless you eyeball it. I mean, it looks pretty even right now. It seems balanced to me. All right, are we good? OK, we put the numbers in. And we can probably just press the next thing then. Yeah. I think we were right. I believe so. You guys done? I believe so. Sweet.",
