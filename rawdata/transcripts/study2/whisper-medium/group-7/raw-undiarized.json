        "text": " Oh, it wasn't. I am not recording yet. Oh, the light was on? Once Joe pops up, then it will be recording. Okay, so I'll read you guys the instructions and then we can get started. Oh, can you take all the blocks off of the scale? Okay, hello and thank you for your participation in this study. Today you will be completing the weights task with the help of Joe, your assistive agent. Joe will intervene as needed. For this task, you will determine the weights of the blocks in front of you. All of the blocks are in intervals of 10 and you do not need to use the slider on the scale. Please submit your answers on a tablet and I will tell you that the red block is 10 grams. And you may now begin the task. You are group 7. No worries guys, I'm European, I know grams. You're European too? Yeah. Why? I'm from Germany. Germany? How about you? Italy. Oh, okay, cool. I have two international kids, that's funny. Okay. Alright. 10 grams. Yellow. Let's put them into... So these are the same. These are the same. And volume? This one's also the same. Because we can use the scale, right? Oh, we could do that. I know 10, red is 10, so... Oh. It means heavier. It means heavier. Or is it? Does this have to be in the middle? Oh, we're not supposed to touch it, I think. Does it have to be at zero? Oh, it has to be zero. I think they're the same. I thought you said not to use the slider. I thought so too. The slider has to be at zero, right? Yes, sorry. It was a... It should be a zero. Yes. Okay. Alright, so that means this one is the same weight. They're the same, yeah. Okay. So 10 grams. This one should probably be heavier. So if we put... Oh, the yellow one's actually heavier. Take them away. I'm actually curious. If we put 10, 10, and then the green one, if I may. Okay, so that means the green one is 20. Wait. Is it? Goddamn it. Yeah, it looks like it. Is it on the red line? Yeah. Okay, so the green one is 20, and that means... Let's see. Yellow is heavy as hell. Look at that. Or, keep that on, I mean. I'm thinking... I'm sorry. I just think the blue one is 30. Yeah. Huh? 30 grams. Okay, so yellow... Wait, yellow is 20, then. No, take yellow on your hand. Yellow is heavier, I think. Oh, so that means... I think yellow is 50. So that's 30. So if we put this as 40, and then yellow... Yellow should be... How much is this already? This is 30. 30? Yeah. Okay, so... We attribute... 50, I think. Alright, let's see. 30 plus 10... Yeah. So this one's 50. Yellow is 50. Do you guys all agree with this? Can we assume that the slider always needs to be at zero to ensure accurate weight calculation? Considering we're starting with a known weight of 10 grams for the red block. Yeah. Isn't the slider to figure out the difference in weight between them? Yeah. So that means if we don't move it, always keep it at zero and compensate with the blocks. That means you can simply do the math. Yeah, and we tested that with making sure that blue and red are the same. Yeah, we're the same. Okay, so green, I think, was blue and red, right? So it was 20 grams. I think we're pretty sure that it's 50. Yellow is 50, green is 20. Oh, we're doing green now? Yep. Are we all agreeing? Green is 20, yeah. I would say so. Blue? Blue was 30. Excuse me. Wait, blue is... 10. We assume that there's a yellow slider at zero. When not moving the red slider will always result in the correct weight calculation for all cases. Considering we've only tested it with blue and red. What's the yellow slider? I don't think there's a yellow slider. I think the cat is happy. I'm actually curious to try with the slider. So we both know that both of them are 10. Excuse me. Can we assume that assuming green is 50 is correct, considering we've previously established it as 20, and we're using the assumption that blue is the smaller one, and we want to ensure our calculation is consistent with the known weights of yellow and red. I don't think that's very coherent. I think we're doing fine without the cat. Okay, so blue, we're just going to put 10. Yeah, I think blue is 10. Purple, which one's purple? Is this one purple? Yeah. Okay. Purple was 30. Okay, let's see. Wait, what was green? Green was 20? Green was 20, so you just need those two. Yep. And then that should be the same weight. 30, right? Okay, so purple, 30. Let me scroll down. Okay. 18. Can we assume purple's weight is 30, assuming green's weight is not 50, considering we've only established blue's weight as 10, and we need to ensure our calculation is consistent with the known information. This is making my brain hurt. Can we assume purple's weight is... I don't think it makes sense what it's saying. Okay, so it's disregarding the weight of the green one as 50, which we've already attributed it as not 50. We've not established blue's weight as 10. It's just... Or we did. Yeah. And we need to ensure... But this doesn't make sense. I'm sorry. I think we're fine. I think it's suggesting a disparity in what we're thinking in logic, but I don't think there's a... But saying green's weight is not 50 doesn't help us in the case of purple. It's not asking a decisive question. Yeah. I don't know. Do we click next? Yeah. Consider this. Can we assume that we've definitively established the weight of blue as 10 before considering it in our calculation? Or do we need to re-examine our assumption about that assumption? We did that. Yeah. So... We can verify it. That's the case. There you go. Come on. All right. Let's listen to the moment. The correct weight of each box would be following yellow 50. Yeah. That's what we had. Good. All right. So we update our worksheet. All right. Where's the issue 2? Smithy answers on the tablet. Yeah, they already did. I think we already did, yeah. It just said, please update on your worksheet. Does updating on your worksheet get notified by the instruction that you have completed? Oh, okay. Do we have to do that? So that... Sorry, that's kind of confusing. That just is like putting the blocks on the worksheet, but... Oh, okay. You don't have to write it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, so we can remember. That's fun. That's purple. That's green. I think it was 20, yeah.",
