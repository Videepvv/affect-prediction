It looks like it's a little more than 30. Just very slightly. But if we're assuming that all of these blocks are in intervals of 10 grams, then we can say that it's 30 grams. Hey, team. All right. I think we should double check the purple block again. It could be heavier than we think. It's heavier than 30. I'd say, probably a little bit. Let's swap this over. But again, we're in intervals of 10. 32 and 1.5, like Benito said earlier.",25.006574630737305,0.22977882623672485,22.427745819091797,25.2554874420166,28.82882308959961,6.4010772705078125,263.5714111328125,402.6442565917969,198.35475158691406,339.7566833496094,0.24349887669086456,0.8263827562332153,0.07726426422595978,0.18314360082149506,0.37240439653396606,0.2951401472091675,3.958068370819092,2.7430338859558105,2.84525728225708,2.400092124938965,0.11644836515188217,0.7060896158218384,28.345050811767578,0.43463635444641113,13.96590518951416,1.0305132865905762,19.606035232543945,0.7085643410682678,10.210731506347656,1.4971083402633667,0.02271239459514618,1.357484221458435,1.3201324939727783,0.631710410118103,3.2687461376190186,1.155091404914856,10.35621166229248,2.590754985809326,28.016809463500977,0.4888960123062134,582.9533081054688,0.3879048824310303,1348.7474365234375,0.1709122359752655,-148.98341369628906,-0.5410609841346741,1638.838134765625,0.1588778793811798,1012.3363037109375,0.3062538802623749,-150.83596801757812,-0.504192054271698,2720.8466796875,0.11416219174861908,979.7734985351562,0.344023734331131,-152.2980194091797,-0.48419344425201416,-17.686649322509766,-0.43767228722572327,27.07379150390625,0.34249502420425415,-0.006282936315983534,-4.596285820007324,-0.010951284319162369,-1.7048698663711548,0.17354930937290192,0.582099199295044,35.59638214111328,0.2803794741630554,7.6159844398498535,2.0525221824645996,19.24650764465332,0.8583822250366211,3.758026599884033,5.35234260559082,-20.132556915283203,28.818523406982422,-0.037300411611795425,-0.00013465291704051197,0.09459524601697922,2.2340779304504395,2.806548833847046,0.0892857164144516,0.1036107987165451,0.2467857152223587,0.2944573760032654,-32.7969856262207

I think we should double check the purple block again. It could be heavier than we think. It's heavier than 30. I'd say, probably a little bit. Let's swap this over. But again, we're in intervals of 10. 32 and 1.5, like Benito said earlier. Pardon the interruption. I agree.

But that was the first good thing that you've said this entire time, as far as I'm concerned.",23.433753967285156,0.25383394956588745,21.323230743408203,23.978355407714844,27.901187896728516,6.5779571533203125,270.2459716796875,325.2056579589844,116.08435821533203,113.5953140258789,0.25261425971984863,0.886694073677063,0.0760582834482193,0.19011704623699188,0.3747144937515259,0.2986562252044678,4.584505558013916,3.1840076446533203,2.688361644744873,2.0789248943328857,0.12309876084327698,0.7539962530136108,29.232114791870117,0.3969695270061493,12.212908744812012,1.3150453567504883,18.514955520629883,0.7458397150039673,10.487282752990723,1.312317967414856,0.02098221518099308,1.427496075630188,1.585684061050415,0.672296404838562,2.114030361175537,1.8988566398620605,9.991564750671387,2.6715052127838135,28.2459659576416,0.38684698939323425,654.6018676757812,0.40844136476516724,1326.0238037109375,0.17488649487495422,-161.78277587890625,-0.44701263308525085,1680.90283203125,0.176844984292984,1026.21533203125,0.2743821442127228,-162.33987426757812,-0.43167001008987427,2758.52978515625,0.12577961385250092,937.8150024414062,0.34449177980422974,-163.75074768066406,-0.41190090775489807,-16.485809326171875,-0.5173107385635376,26.504087448120117,0.341124564409256,-0.007321773562580347,-4.348422050476074,-0.00806355755776167,-2.042156934738159,0.19606594741344452,0.7263205051422119,34.13987350463867,0.23508889973163605,4.273134708404541,3.954655408859253,16.67850685119629,0.8698073029518127,4.627892017364502,3.79919171333313,-19.77130699157715,28.972517013549805,-0.03312818333506584,-0.00025019404711201787,0.10408319532871246,2.3674557209014893,2.672903537750244,0.06849999725818634,0.05463743954896927,0.30013158917427063,0.3000328540802002,-32.40896224975586
